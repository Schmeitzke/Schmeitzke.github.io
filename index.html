						    My academic journey began after graduating from middle school, leading me to enroll in <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">Maastricht University</a> where I pursued studies in Fiscal Economics. For two years, I delved into the complexities of fiscal economics and law, developing a deep appreciation for these fields. However, as I envisioned my future, I realized my passion lay elsewhere.<br>
						    In 2022, I made the pivotal decision to transition into the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program at Maastricht Universityâ€”a choice I have wholeheartedly embraced. The dynamic realms of data science and AI have captivated me from the start, and I have dedicated myself fully to mastering these disciplines.<br>
						    As a freelancer, I have extensive experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and am open to a wide range of projects within the data science and AI fields. My current project involves developing advanced LLM systems for analyzing financial communications, aimed at informing strategic decisions in the financial markets.<br>
						    Beyond my academic and professional endeavors, I have gained practical experience across various sectors. I served as a Housing Assistant at <a href="https://www.zuyderland.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">Zuyderland</a>, supporting elderly residents, including those with dementia, during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. My commitment to enhancing the quality of life and well-being of residents continued post-pandemic, where I provided ongoing support to both elderly individuals and the broader community.<br>
						    Earlier in my career, I worked as a door-to-door sales representative for Spark, promoting sustainable products such as solar panels, insulation, and heating and cooling solutions. This role honed my skills in sales, communication, and advocating for environmentally friendly initiatives.<br>
						    In addition to my professional work, I am actively involved in my local community. I take pride in being a member of a <a href="https://www.bdbroosteren.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">foundation</a> that organizes a variety of events throughout the year in my village.<br>
						    I am always open to new freelance opportunities and collaborations. If you have a project where my expertise in data science and AI can be of assistance, please feel free to contact me.
