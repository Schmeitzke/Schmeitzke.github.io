						<p>My academic journey began with my graduation from middle school, and I subsequently enrolled in <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">Maastricht University</a> to study fiscal economics. For two years, I delved into the intricacies of fiscal economics and law, finding them genuinely fascinating. However, as I looked toward the future, I couldn't envision myself pursuing a career in that field.
							In 2022, I decided to pivot and embrace a new academic path by enrolling in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence program at Maastricht University. It was a decision I haven't regretted. The world of data science and AI captivated me from the start, and I've been fully dedicated to my studies ever since.<br>
							In my current role as a Financial AI Developer, I am developing a Large Language Model (LLM) for sentiment and data analysis of financial news and press releases. This project aims to inform trading decisions in the futures market by analyzing communications from companies, governments, and individuals about their financials and growth.<br>
							Beyond academics and professional work, I also have practical experience in diverse fields. As a Housing Assistant at <a href="https://www.zuyderland.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">Zuyderland</a>, I provided support to elderly residents, including those with dementia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-pandemic, I continued to support both elderly individuals and general residents, focusing on enhancing their quality of life and well-being.<br>
							Additionally, I work as an independent contractor for <a href="https://outlier.ai/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">Outlier.ai</a>, focusing on the assessment of large language models (LLMs). I also previously engaged as a door-to-door sales representative for Spark, promoting sustainable products including solar panels, insulation, and heating and cooling solutions.<br>
							Beyond academics, I actively engage with my local community. I'm proud to be a member of a <a href="https://www.bdbroosteren.nl/" style="color: rgb(0, 191, 255);">foundation</a> that organizes a variety of events throughout the year in my small village.</p>
